<p>Google Docs allows users to create and edit documents online while collaborating with users in real-time. Edits are tracked by the user making the edit, with a revision history presenting changes.[4] An editor's position is highlighted with an editor-specific color and cursor, and a permissions system regulates what users can do. Updates have introduced features using machine learning, including "Explore", offering search results based on the contents of a document, and "Action items", allowing users to assign tasks to other users.[5]</p>
